$ graph
- hamiltonian paths = start from the source and cover all the nodes without visiting any node twice
- hamiltonian cycle = hamiltonian path ka last node src se direct edge rkhta ho to vo hamiltonian cycle

- cycle detection in undirected = agar ek node mei pohnchne ke ek se zyada tareeke 
- cycle detection in directed = isme agar BFS se kiya to kaam khtm
	/\	
       /  \	
      _\||/_  aisi ko bhi cycle bolega ye
- so its better to use self dfs with fresh visited boolean array using backtracking in cycle detection in directed &&&&&& self - bfs in undirected with common vis array	


- bipartite = 2 sets mei divide kr skta hu vertices jisse all the edges are across the set and none in btw the vert of a set
- every non - cyclic graph is bipartite
- every cyclic odd vertices is never a bipartite
- solve in case of cyclic even vertices!
