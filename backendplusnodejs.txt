$ why backend?
- javascript writen on the web apps(using the environment provided by the browser) can only interact with the site and do functions related to that like, animations , eventListners 
- But js writen on the backend(where nodejs is an environment) can act as a server and interact with the computer hardware of the viewer to provide services, make sum inbuilt code to make the site run faster, etc.
- Database needs to connect with a server that is implemented in the backend. 
- Web app consists of application(mostly frontend) , server(backend) , database.
- nobody can see how u implement ur code

$ nodeJS
- is a runtime environment refer (https://hackr.io/blog/what-is-frameworks)

$ nodeJs modules?
- Consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries. A set of functions you want to include in your application.
- You can even create ur own module and require it to use as a module.
- http is also a module

$ express
- Express is a popular unopinionated web framework, written in JavaScript and hosted within the Node. js runtime environment
- Express bolta hai node ko ki tu mere tareeke se code likh mai tere according output laake dunga -- framework yehi krta hai
- Express. js is based on the Node. js middleware module called connect which in turn uses http module. 
- If we didnt use express to build the server (refer : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Node_server_without_framework), ye krna pdta nodejs mei to start hosting a server

$ api
- An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of functions that allows applications to access data and interact with external software components, operating systems, or microservices. 
- To simplify, an API delivers a user response to a system and sends the system's response back to a user.
- Endpoints, Path and parameters(implemented using hashmap that find the things which contains this keyword)

$ EJS
- template library
- <% ..... %> javascript
- <%= ....... %> customizable according to user input data
- <%- ...... -%> partials include

$ database
- NoSQL - MongoDB and SQL - MySQL
- MySQL - structured/predefinded structure of the data like the excel sheet - more space(contains null elements) - vertical scaling
- MongoDB - random ordered data - flexible - not good in building relationships between different datas - easier for one maker and 1000s of users - horizontal scaling
- mongoose is a node module

$ REST API
- HTTPS S stands for secured using cryptography , HTTP is a request language used globally like app.get(function(req , res)) -> req here is HTTP request thats why require HTTP node module in app.js
- Server responds in the form of fulfilling the request. -> this is what API is
- REST API is a Architecture style global standard, to work together and have a common structure of writing/ doing things.
- HTTP verbs to make API restful - get , post , put , patch , delete
- app.get
- app.post
- app.put/patch -- to update the data
- app.delete
- Put vs Patch - put is to change the whole entry whereas patch is to fix/update a part of entry/data;

$ git/github
- ls -a (force show the inherit folders/file)
- git checkout (XXXXXX)log code -- travel in different logs/ branches
- git branch -- new branch 
- git checkout -b -- new branch and usko checkout seedha
- git merge <branch name> -- merge this branch into current 

- git add origin <git repo>
- git remote -v
